_Phytoplankton Blooms in a Loop Current Eddy_

This repo includes some notes and instructions on how to set up, run and troubleshoot **WRF, NEMO** and **OASIS** on **chaman** (CICESE). 
Hope this helps to another lost soul!

## Uncoupled models
### WRF
1. [WRF Install & compile](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/blob/main/models/uncoupled/install_configure_compile_WRF_4.1.3.md)
2. [WPS Install & compile](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/blob/main/models/uncoupled/install_configure_compile_WPS_4.1.md)
3. [Pre-processing](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/blob/main/models/uncoupled/pre-processing.md)
4. [Run](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/blob/main/models/uncoupled/run.md)

### NEMO
1. [NEMO configure & compile](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/edit/main/models/uncoupled/NEMO/install_configure_compile_NEMO_4.0.md)
2. [Run](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/blob/main/models/uncoupled/NEMO/run_nemo.md)
3. [Create new experiment](https://github.com/ivonnegarciam/blooms/blob/main/models/uncoupled/NEMO/create_new_experiment.md)

### OASIS
1. OASIS Install & compile

## Coupled models (NOW: NEMO-OASIS-WRF)
### XIOS with OASIS

### NEMO with OASIS & XIOS

### WRF with OASIS & XIOS

### NOW (NEMO-OASIS-WRF)
Coming soon

## Acknowledgements
The current compilation of notes and files includes inputs, comments and solutions proposed by several coleagues at CICESE. In particular, I would like to thank Julio Sheinbaum, Julien Jouanno, Favio Medrano and Alejandro Dominguez PÃ©rez for their technical support and guidance.
